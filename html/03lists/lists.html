    <h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>
    <p>
        Eggs are one of my favourite foods. Here is a
        recipe for deliciously rich scrambled eggs.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>1tbs butter</li>
        <li>2tbs cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat</li>
        <li>Gently mix the eggs and cream in a bowl</li>
        <li>Once butter has melted add cream and eggs</li>
        <li>Using a spatula fold the eggs from the edge of the pan to the center every 20 seconds (as if
            you are making an omelette)</li>
        <li>When the eggs are still moist remove from the heat (it will continue to cook on the plate
            until served)</li>
    </ol>
