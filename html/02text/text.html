    <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>
        Molly has been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk,
        lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>. <i>New Scientist</i>, and all the other
        scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of
        <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer
        she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
    </p>
    <p>
        She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde
        quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>
        although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secret of the llama
        <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement. Molly
        <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
