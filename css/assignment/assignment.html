    <h1>PIAIC</h1>
    <h2>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing</h2>
    <p>
        (PIAIC) is a privately funded not-for-profit educational initiative started by President of
        Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help promote education,
        research and business opportunities in emerging tech fields like Artificial Intelligence,
        Blockchain, Internet of Things and Cloud Native computing.[2] The initiative was
        inaugurated in Karachi by President Dr. Arif Alvi on January 20, 2019. The program
        provides both on-site classes in Karachi as well as online instructions via e-learning
        videos available on the PIAIC website.[4] However, students need to be present onsite
        for examinations throughout the course of one-year program for most courses.

    <h2 id="ai">Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
        The artificial intelligence program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI
        technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like Python, Numpy, Pandas,
        Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and
        ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice
    </p>
    <h2 id="cnc">Cloud Native Computing</h2>
    <p>
        The Cloud Native Computing program prepares the students to program in open source
        technologies like, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React
        Native while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software
        development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>
    <h2 id="bc">Blockchain Computing</h2>
    <p>
        The main emphasis of Blockchain program is to understand the blockchains like Ethereum
        and Hyperledger (Fabric), and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript
        on frameworks like Node.js. The program also introduces them to development of Distributed
        Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth understanding of
        Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
        of a crypto-token.
    </p>
    <h2 id="iot">Internet of Things</h2>
    <p>
        The Internet of things program introduces the students to open source development
        technologies like Rust, Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant,
        and Kubernetes while making them efficient in developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud,
        and voice computing for device control.
